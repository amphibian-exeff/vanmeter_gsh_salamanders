# The glasso function is then used to fit a sparse Gaussian graphical model to the data, 
# with the penalize.diag argument set to TRUE to ensure that the diagonal elements of the 
# precision matrix are also penalized. The estimated precision matrix is extracted from the 
# fit object and is passed to the graph.adjacency function of the igraph library. This 
# function is used to create an igraph object representing the network structure of the data. 
# Finally, the plot function of the igraph library is used to visualize the network structure.
